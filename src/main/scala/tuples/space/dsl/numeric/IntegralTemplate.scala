/** The trait for generalizing the creation of integral [[JsonTemplate]]s.
  *
  * This trait allows to create a family of traits which represents the states in which an integral template can be in after
  * specifying some constraint or other. The template starts "empty", meaning that it is able to match all numeric values for its
  * type. Then, a minimum or maximum value can be specified, either inclusive or exclusive. Another constraint allows to specify
  * the missing half part of the interval. The interval can be left half-open and its limits can be specified in any order. The
  * last constraint that can be specified is the "multiple of" one, which allows to constrain the values that the template can
  * match to only the integral values which are multiple of the given one. After this, template is "complete" and without further
  * constraints to apply. This last constraint can be inserted in any moment during its creation: before, during, or after the
  * specification of the range constraint.
