/** A type-class representing the operations that must be supported by a tuple-like object.
  *
  * Objects representing tuples, being so, must provide some operations that are expected to work on them. A tuple must allow to
  * peek its internal structure in a predictable way, giving access to its number of elements, the elements at any given position,
  * its head or its tail, to the initial part of it or the ending element. A tuple must also provide operations to update it,
  * returning a new tuple, in a similar fashion to a sequence. So, elements can be appended, dropped, filtered, mapped,
  * flat-mapped, taken, folded or an action can be performed for each one of them. At last, a tuple can be concatenated to another
  * tuple, it can be converted to a Seq, existing a bijective relationship between them, split into two or zipped with another.
