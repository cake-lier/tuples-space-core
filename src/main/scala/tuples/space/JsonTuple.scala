/** A tuple, an object representing an immutable and ordered sequence of values of different types.
 *
 * This implementation of a tuple is a "JSON" tuple, meaning that it is built on the fundamental concepts of the JSON format,
 * enabling an easier exchange of data over the wire. This is because JSON is now the de-facto format for the data exchange on the
 * web, which in turn is the standard for building distributed architectures, namely webservices. This means that a JSON tuple is
 * the same concept as a JSON array, so an indexed sequence of values allowed in JSON, minus the "JSON object". Objects are not
 * allowed since this would violate the rigid structure of a tuple: this would allow to objects to nest tuples inside them, which
 * could nest other objects, which in turn could nest other tuples and so on and so forth. This would not correctly represent what
 * in most programming languages is a sequence or list of elements. However, tuples can be nested into other tuples, enabling the
 * equivalent of a matrix or of a jagged array. Their usefulness is in representing simple, not deeply nested data structures,
 * such as messages or events exchanged in a distributed system.
